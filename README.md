# Time-dependent variational principle with Superposition-Davydov D2 ansatz

A numerical package for simulating excitation dynamics of the system-bath model using the time-dependent variational method with the Superposition-Davydov D2 trial wavefunctions. The package is implemented in Python 3. 

The package was developed for analysis of molecular internal conversion process presented in DOI: [10.1039/d0cp01092h](https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp01092h)

It can simulate excitation dynamics of a molecule with an arbitrary number of non-adiabaticaly coupled electronic states and vibrational potential surfaces, while being coupled to the harmonic thermal bath.
